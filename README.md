Hello World!
I am a student at WGU in IT Software Development. I am currently learning how to become a fulltime software developer to start my career in the wonderful world of programming. I currently work in IT in a help desk role. I also manage our spiceworks ticketing system. Starting in September I will be working with a SR Programmer to develop a new backend and frontend for our internal website at our company. I am very excited to be doing what I love.
